Chapter 3 The Dyscalculia Checklist: Thirty-one characteristics that can contribute to maths failure ... 32
  1. Finds it impossible to ‘see’ that four objects are four without counting (or three objects, if a young child) ... 32
  2. Has difficulty counting objects accurately and lacks the ability to make ‘one-to-one correspondence’ ... 33
  3. Finds it much harder to count backwards compared to counting forwards ... 33
  4. Counts on for addition facts, for example, for 6 + 3, counts on ‘7, 8, 9’ to get the answer ... 33
  5. Has difficulty with retrieving addition facts from memory ... 34
  6. Counts all the numbers when adding, for example, for 5 + 3, counts ‘1, 2, 3, 4, 5 … 6, 7, 8’ ... 35
  7. Finds it difficult to count fluently sequences that are less familiar, such as 1, 3, 5, 7 … or 4, 14, 24, 34 … ... 36
  8. Uses tally marks for addition or subtraction problems ... 36
  9. Has difficulty in progressing from the materials and images, for example, counters, blocks, tallies, to the symbols/numbers ... 36
  10. Has poor skills with money, for example, unable to calculate change from a purchase ... 37
  11. Thinks an item priced at £4.99 is ‘£4 and a bit’ rather than almost £5 ... 37
  12. ‘Sees’ numbers literally and not inter-related, for example, counts up from 1 to get 9, rather than using 10 – 1 ... 37
  13. Finds it difficult to write numbers which have zeros within them, such as, ‘three hundred and four’ or ‘four thousand and twenty-one’ ... 38
  14. Finds estimating impossible ... 38
  15. Finds it difficult to judge whether an answer is right, or nearly right (and do they even look at an answer?) ... 38
  16. Organises written work poorly, for example does not line up columns of numbers properly ... 39
  17. Doesn’t ‘see’ automatically that 7 + 5 is the same as 5 + 7 (or that 7 × 3 is the same as 3 × 7) ... 39
  18. Writes 51 for fifteen or 61 for sixteen (and the same ‘reversal’ for all the teen numbers) ... 39
  19. Forgets the question asked in mental arithmetic ... 39
  20. Struggles with mental arithmetic ... 40
  21. Learns multiplication facts, but then forgets
