Course spine	COLLECTION→ARRANGEMENT→DIRECTION→PROXIMITY→SAMENESS→CHANGE→RATE→ACCUMULATION→SPREAD.
Universal solving rule	Choose object → choose “same” → compute → verify.
SAMENESS-A vs SAMENESS-B	Same state different description vs invariant under transformations.
RATE vs CHANGE boundary	RATE is change w.r.t time; CHANGE is sensitivity to input.
Verification habit	Relabel/units/basis/bins then check correct behavior.
Equilibrium energy populations: (A)CHANGE (B)SPREAD (C)DIRECTION	B
Total product from rate: (A)ACCUMULATION (B)SAMENESS (C)PROXIMITY	A
Limiting reagent primitive	COLLECTION.
Projection operation	Dot product / projection (DIRECTION).
Histogram minimal check	Total area/count correct; units labeled.
Anti-pattern	Confusing representation artifacts with the object.
Why detail can reduce truth	Overfitting; robustness matters.
Map use	Question → primitive → operation.
Unit discipline	Units must be explicit; converting units must change numbers predictably.
When models tie	Prefer predictive performance and simpler assumptions; test on new data.
