Recognition: When are you in SAMENESS-B?	When you declare two situations 'the same' because an invariant stays unchanged under an allowed transformation.
Complete the sentence: 'Same under ____'.	…a specified set of allowed transformations (e.g., rotations, translations).
Which invariant is preserved by pure rotations?	Vector components / Dot product / Column order / Index labels
Answer: Dot product
Rotations (orthogonal transforms) preserve dot products/norms.
Orthogonal test in one line.	RᵀR = I.
Numeric: v=(3,4). After a 90° rotation, |v| = ?	Still 5.
Theorem: If RᵀR=I, then (Ru)·(Rv) = ?	u·v.
Chem: why is bond length invariant?	Because it is a physical distance, independent of coordinate frame.
What breaks invariance of length?	Non-orthogonal transforms like scaling/shear.
What is an 'allowed transformation' in a physical model?	A change you treat as symmetry (does not alter the state).
Give one world example of invariance.	Speed invariant under changing compass direction representation.
In data analysis, what is an invariant of a square matrix often used?	Trace or determinant (depending on context).

If two vectors have dot product 0, what does that mean?	They are orthogonal (90° angle).
True/False: Any matrix with det=1 is a rotation.	False (shears can have det=1).
Why does 'state the invariant' prevent hand-waving?	It forces a checkable computation before/after the transformation.
