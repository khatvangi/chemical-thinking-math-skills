Symmetry (1 line)?	A transformation that leaves the object unchanged.
Square: number of 90° rotations that map to itself?	4.
CO2 dipole is zero because:
A. bonds nonpolar
B. bond dipoles cancel by symmetry	Answer: B
Linear symmetry cancels.
If a quantity flips sign under a symmetry, what can be forced?	Average/allowed value may be 0 by cancellation.
Chiral object vs mirror:
A. superimposable
B. not superimposable	Answer: B
Chirality breaks mirror superposition.
Smallest rotation of regular hexagon mapping to itself?	60°.
Symmetry helps computation by:	Compute once; replicate by symmetry.
Water dipole vs CO2 dipole?	Water nonzero (bent); CO2 zero (linear).
Is symmetry SAMENESS-B?
A. Yes
B. No	Answer: A
It is invariance under allowed transformations.
Verification habit for symmetry claims?	Apply the move; check invariants.
