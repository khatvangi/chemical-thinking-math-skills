SPREAD recognition sentence	Repeated trials vary even when the setup is fixed → SPREAD.
Sample space vs event	Sample space = all outcomes; event = subset with a condition.
Independence	P(A∩B)=P(A)P(B).
P(exactly 2 heads in 3 flips), p=0.6	0.432
Binomial PMF	P(X=k)=C(n,k)p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
Normalization	Probabilities must sum to 1.
Extreme cases (p=0,1)	Collapse to k=0 or k=n.
Mean & SD of Binomial(20,0.5)	10; 2.236
Bernoulli mean/var	p; p(1-p).
Chem mapping: occupancy	Bound/unbound ↔ Bernoulli; p=occupancy.
Histogram invariance	Total count/mass invariant; binning is representation.
Quick SE for p-hat	SE≈sqrt(p̂(1-p̂)/n).
Shuffle trials changes p̂? A yes B no	B
Poisson use-case	Rare events; counts per interval/volume.
Model vs estimate	p is model; p̂ is estimate from data.
