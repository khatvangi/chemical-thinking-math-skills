Recognition: What is a characteristic direction?	A direction v that comes back parallel after applying A: Av = λv.
One line: eigenvalue meaning.	Scale factor along an eigenvector direction.
For A=diag(2,5), eigenvectors are…	(1,1) only / any nonzero vector / (1,0) and (0,1) / none
Answer: (1,0) and (0,1)
Diagonal matrices scale coordinate axes independently.
2×2 symmetric characteristic polynomial for [[a,b],[b,c]]?	(a−λ)(c−λ) − b².
Invariant check: trace(A) equals what in terms of eigenvalues?	Sum of eigenvalues.
Invariant check: det(A) equals what in terms of eigenvalues?	Product of eigenvalues.
Chem: principal axes are eigenvectors of what kind of matrix?	A symmetric matrix (e.g., inertia tensor, covariance, force constants).
Numeric: For A=[[3,1],[1,1]], trace=? det=?	trace=4; det=2.
Why do eigenvectors matter geometrically?	They define axes where the transformation acts as pure scaling (no mixing).
When are eigenvectors orthogonal (simple condition)?	When A is symmetric (distinct eigenvalues).
World: PCA finds eigenvectors of what matrix?	Covariance matrix.
Normal modes in vibrations are eigenvectors of what?	Force-constant (Hessian) matrix (approx).
Under rotation of coordinates, do eigenvectors themselves stay fixed?	No; they rotate with the basis, but eigenvalues stay invariant.

Quick test for 'is v an eigenvector'?	Compute Av and check if it is a scalar multiple of v.
