Primary PRIMITIVE: EXISTENCE (setup)
Neighbors to contrast: SAMENESS-A (same state, different description), PROXIMITY (limits/approach), CHANGE (rules of variation)

One-line thesis:
- You can only model a chemical phenomenon with a number system that is **closed under the operations** the phenomenon forces you to perform.

## 0) Scenes (no explanation)

A. Chemistry: **NMR FID** as an oscillation with amplitude and phase (signal is naturally complex).  
B. Physics/Chemistry: **quantum phase** in a wavefunction (you cannot delete *i* without changing interference).  
C. Everyday: **debt / deficits** (you cannot describe “below zero” with ℕ).

1-minute prompt:
- What breaks if you restrict yourself to “only positive counting numbers”?
- What operation do you *need* to do here?
- What does the phenomenon force you to represent?

## 1) Diagnosis (when you’re in “Existence of a number system”)

Recognition sentence:
- **“My current numbers cannot represent the state, or cannot survive the operation I must perform.”** → therefore you must **extend** the number system.

Fast checks:
- [ ] Subtraction produces something “not allowed” (e.g., 3 − 7).
- [ ] Division produces something “not allowed” (e.g., 1 ÷ 2).
- [ ] A limit/measurement produces something “not allowed” (e.g., √2 as a length).
- [ ] A model equation has no solution in the current system (e.g., x² + 1 = 0 in ℝ).

Boundary lines (don’t mix):
- **SAMENESS-A**: same object, different description (1/2 = 0.5 = 50%).
- **EXISTENCE**: the *set of allowed states* is wrong until you enlarge it.

---

## 2) What exists here (object + equivalence)

Specification:
- Objects: number systems as **sets with operations** (+, −, ×, ÷ when defined).
- Allowed descriptions: symbols, decimals, fractions, coordinates on a line/plane.
- “Same” means: equal value (two representations denote the same element).
- “Different” means: cannot be made equal without changing the system/axioms.

Sanity rule:
- If two forms denote the same number, every valid operation must give the same result (representation must not change the chemistry).

---

## 3) What you compute (quantities + units)

Primary quantities:
- **State variable**: can this phenomenon be represented as a scalar? (count, charge, energy, phase)
- **Closure test**: does the system remain closed under required operations?

Units:
- Many chemical quantities carry units; the number system concerns the **numerical** part.
- Dimensionless quantities (activities, probabilities, phase angles) often expose the needed structure fastest.

---

## 4) What you do (operation)

Operation:
- Start with a number system \(S\).
- Identify a required operation \(⊙\) such that \(S\) is **not closed** under \(⊙\).
- Extend to a minimal \(S' \supset S\) that is closed under the needed operations.

Interpretation:
- The extension is not “mathematical luxury.” It is a **representation requirement** imposed by the phenomenon.

---

## 5) Tool ladder (L0 → L3)

**L0 (concrete):** You try to compute something physically meaningful and the answer “doesn’t exist” in your current numbers.  
**L1 (formal):** Define closure: \(S\) is closed under \(⊙\) if \(a,b\in S \Rightarrow a⊙b \in S\).  
**L2 (structure):** Build the minimal extension that restores closure and solves the model equations.  
**L3 (chemistry-grade):** Use the correct number system to represent phase, oscillations, spectra, equilibrium constraints, and linear algebra states later.

---

## 6) The chain of extensions (the course spine)

We use this ladder repeatedly:

| System | What it represents cleanly | What forced it into existence |
|---|---|---|
| \( \mathbb{N} \) | counting | COLLECTION only; no deficits |
| \( \mathbb{Z} \) | signed counts | subtraction must always work |
| \( \mathbb{Q} \) | ratios | division must always work (except by 0) |
| \( \mathbb{R} \) | measured continua | lengths/energies/limits are not always rational |
| \( \mathbb{C} \) | phase + oscillation + eigen-structure | equations like \(x^2+1=0\); Fourier/quantum phase |

---

## 7) One theorem that matters (short proof sketch)

**Theorem (Irrationality of \( \sqrt{2} \)):** There is no rational number \(p/q\) (in lowest terms) such that \((p/q)^2 = 2\).

Proof sketch (checkable):
1. Assume \(\sqrt{2} = p/q\) with integers \(p,q\) and \(\gcd(p,q)=1\).
2. Then \(2 = p^2/q^2 \Rightarrow p^2 = 2q^2\).
3. So \(p^2\) is even → \(p\) is even → \(p=2k\).
4. Substitute: \(4k^2 = 2q^2 \Rightarrow q^2 = 2k^2\).
5. Thus \(q\) is even.
6. Both \(p\) and \(q\) even contradict \(\gcd(p,q)=1\).
7. Therefore \(\sqrt{2}\notin \mathbb{Q}\).

What it buys you:
- Even simple geometry forces you out of \(\mathbb{Q}\) into \(\mathbb{R}\).

---

## 8) One real computation (data, not invented)

### Example: complex sinusoid as a measurement model (FID / AC response)

Measured signal (one channel):
\[
s(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \varphi)
\]

Complex representation:
\[
s(t) = \Re\left( A e^{i(\omega t + \varphi)} \right)
\]

What students compute:
- Given \(A,\omega,\varphi\), generate \(s(t)\) and the rotating phasor \(A e^{i(\omega t+\varphi)}\).

Interpretation:
- The real signal is a **shadow** of a rotating complex quantity.
- Phase \(\varphi\) is not optional; it changes interference, peak shapes, and fitted parameters.

Sanity checks:
- If \(\varphi\) changes, \(s(t)\) shifts in time (same amplitude, different alignment).
- If \(A=0\), signal is identically zero regardless of phase.

(If you have an actual FID vector file later, replace this section with a short CSV-driven example.)

---

## 9) Invariance test (anti-float requirement)

Claim:
- The *measurable* real signal is invariant under changing representation from cosine form to complex-exponential form.

Test:
- Compute \(s(t)\) two ways:
  1) \(A\cos(\omega t+\varphi)\)
  2) \(\Re(Ae^{i(\omega t+\varphi)})\)
- Verify equality over a grid of \(t\) values (numerically in Pluto).

If it fails:
- Your complex arithmetic or “take real part” step is wrong; the physics didn’t change.

---

## 10) Chemistry anchors (≥3)

### Anchor A — NMR / spectroscopy phase
- You see: an oscillatory signal with phase shifts across experiments.
- You diagnose: EXISTENCE because ℝ-only numbers cannot represent phase naturally.
- You compute: phasor \(Ae^{i(\omega t+\varphi)}\), then take real part.
- You conclude: phase must be represented explicitly to model signals and fit parameters.

### Anchor B — quantum mechanics (phase is physical in interference)
- You see: interference depends on relative phase.
- You diagnose: EXISTENCE because removing \(i\) destroys the structure of the model.
- You compute: complex amplitudes and their superposition.
- You conclude: complex numbers are required by the theory’s predictions, not by taste.

### Anchor C — equilibrium / log scales (preview only)
- You see: quantities like \(\log K\), \(\Delta G = -RT\ln K\).
- You diagnose: EXISTENCE because chemistry often moves between multiplicative and additive worlds.
- You compute: \(K\) vs \(\ln K\) transformations.
- You conclude: representation choice changes tractability, not the underlying chemistry (links to SAMENESS-A later).

## 11) Notebook spec (Pluto) — required

Visual 1 (phasor + real signal):
- `@bind A` range `0:0.1:5` units (arb.)
- `@bind ϕ` range `-π:0.01:π` units (rad)
- Fixed (or slider): `ω` range `0.5:0.1:10` units (rad/s)
- Output:
  - plot of \(s(t)\) over \(t\in[0,T]\)
  - complex-plane point tracing \(Ae^{i(\omega t+\varphi)}\)
- Must notice:
  - changing \(ϕ\) shifts alignment; changing \(A\) scales magnitude

Visual 2 (closure ladder quick test):
- `@bind system` dropdown: `ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ`
- `@bind operation` dropdown: `subtract, divide, sqrt, solve x²+1=0`
- Output: “allowed / not allowed” + minimal counterexample (e.g., 3−7, 1/2, √2)

---

## 12) Misconceptions (falsifiable tests)

- If you think “complex numbers are imaginary so they aren’t physical,” test whether your spectroscopy model still fits when you delete phase.
- If you think “ℚ is enough for measurements,” test whether any rational squared equals 2 (use the theorem).
- If you think “extensions are arbitrary,” test closure: try to do required operations inside the smaller system.

## 13) Exercises (15; first two are diagnosis-only)

1) **Diagnosis:** Which number system is required to represent a deficit of 3 electrons relative to neutrality? Why?  
2) **Diagnosis:** A model requires solving \(x^2+1=0\). Where does the solution live?  
3) Show explicitly: \( \mathbb{N} \) is not closed under subtraction (give a counterexample).  
4) Show explicitly: \( \mathbb{Z} \) is not closed under division (give a counterexample).  
5) Convert: \(0.125\) to a fraction in lowest terms. What system is it in?  
6) Prove (sketch): if \(p^2\) is even, then \(p\) is even.  
7) Use the theorem structure to prove \(\sqrt{3}\notin\mathbb{Q}\) (outline is enough).  
8) Explain: why does “measurement with arbitrary precision” push you toward \(\mathbb{R}\) rather than \(\mathbb{Q}\)?  
9) Compute: for \(A=2\), \(\omega=3\), \(\varphi=\pi/4\), write \(s(t)=A\cos(\omega t+\varphi)\) and its complex form.  
10) Verify numerically (small table): \(A\cos(\omega t+\varphi) = \Re(Ae^{i(\omega t+\varphi)})\) for 3 values of \(t\).  
11) Solve in \(\mathbb{R}\): \(x^2-2=0\). Explain why this is a “number system” issue.  
12) Solve in \(\mathbb{C}\): \(x^2+1=0\). Write both solutions.  
13) If \(z = 3-4i\), compute \(|z|\). Interpret geometrically.  
14) Give one chemical context where “phase” matters and cannot be ignored.  
15) Short essay (6–8 lines): “A number system is a set of allowed states plus allowed operations.” Give one chemistry example where the wrong set breaks the model.

### Solutions (brief)

1) \( \mathbb{Z} \): deficits require negatives.  
2) \( \mathbb{C} \): \(x=\pm i\).  
3) Example: \(3-7=-4\notin \mathbb{N}\).  
4) Example: \(1/2\notin \mathbb{Z}\).  
5) \(0.125=125/1000=1/8\in\mathbb{Q}\).  
6) If \(p\) odd, \(p=2k+1\Rightarrow p^2=4k(k+1)+1\) odd; contrapositive gives result.  
7) Same structure as \(\sqrt2\): assume \(p^2=3q^2\), show \(p,q\) divisible by 3 → contradiction.  
8) Because not all limits/lengths are rational; rationals are dense but incomplete (preview for PROXIMITY).  
9) \(s(t)=2\cos(3t+\pi/4)\); complex: \(\Re(2e^{i(3t+\pi/4)})\).  
10) Direct substitution; equality holds by Euler formula.  
11) \(x=\pm\sqrt2\), not rational in general → needs \(\mathbb{R}\).  
12) \(x=\pm i\).  
13) \(|z|=\sqrt{3^2+(-4)^2}=5\).  
14) NMR phasing / interferometry / QM superposition; phase affects observable interference.  
15) Must mention closure + example (e.g., equilibrium uses logs; oscillations use complex phasors).
