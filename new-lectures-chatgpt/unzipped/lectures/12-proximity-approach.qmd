Primary primitive: **PROXIMITY**

## Scenes

A. Chemistry

![Chem scene](../assets/lessons/12-proximity-approach/scene_A_chem.png)

*In chemistry you tune a knob (T, concentration) and watch behavior approach a regime.*

B. Math

![Math scene](../assets/lessons/12-proximity-approach/scene_B_math.png)

*A function near a point: approach can be well-behaved or wild.*

C. World

![World scene](../assets/lessons/12-proximity-approach/scene_C_world.png)

*Physical approach: you get arbitrarily close without being equal.*

## Diagnosis

Recognition sentence:
- **If what matters is behavior 'near' a point, not at the point → therefore PROXIMITY.**

Fast checks:

- [ ] I care about 'close to' more than 'equal to'.
- [ ] Tiny changes in input can cause bounded changes in output (or not).
- [ ] I can state what 'close' means (tolerance/scale).

## The object

Object: limit behavior. A statement about what happens as input approaches a value.

## The tool

Operations you can do:

- Evaluate limits numerically/graphically to test hypotheses.
- Use 'tolerance language' (within ε) to avoid handwaving.
- Separate value-at-point from behavior-near-point.

## Chemistry anchors

- Infinite dilution: activity ≈ concentration (approach ideality).
- Low-pressure gases: Z→1 as P→0 (ideal-gas regime).
- Approach equilibrium: deviations shrink as t increases (qualitative).

## Verification habit

Before you accept a result, run one of these:
- Change the description (units/coordinates/basis) and confirm the *invariant* claim.
- Push a parameter toward a boundary (very small / very large) and see if your rule still makes sense.

## Exercises (with solutions)

**1.** Compute lim_{x→0} x·sin(1/x).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**0** (bounded sin(1/x) times x→0).

</details>

**2.** Explain: why 'value at x=0' can differ from the limit as x→0.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Limit is about nearby behavior; point value can be assigned independently.

</details>

**3.** Using 1 atm≈101.3 kPa, what is P→0.1 atm in kPa?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

≈**10.13 kPa**.

</details>

**4.** If Z(P)=1+0.02P (P in atm), what is lim_{P→0} Z?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**1**.

</details>

**5.** Does approaching a point guarantee reaching it?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

No. Approach is about getting arbitrarily close.

</details>

**6.** Give a chemistry example of a 'boundary' you approach.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Examples: infinite dilution, low-pressure, high-temperature limit.

</details>

**7.** If f(x)=1/x, what happens as x→0+ ?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

It **diverges to +∞**.

</details>

**8.** Why do we like dimensionless small parameters in proximity arguments?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

They define what 'close' means on a scale.

</details>

**9.** Evaluate lim_{x→∞} 1/x.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**0**.

</details>

**10.** If a model is valid for x<0.1, what is your 'proximity' statement?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Stay within that regime; do not extrapolate.

</details>

**11.** Compute lim_{x→0} (sin x)/x.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**1**.

</details>

**12.** What is the main failure mode in proximity reasoning?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Assuming behavior at the boundary equals behavior near it (or ignoring scale).

</details>

**13.** If g(x)= (1-cos x)/x^2 near 0, what does it approach?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**1/2** (standard limit).

</details>

**14.** In ideal solution limit, what tends to 1?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Activity coefficient γ → **1**.

</details>

**15.** State the recognition sentence in your own words.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Equivalent paraphrase acceptable.
