Primary primitive: **CHANGE**

## Scenes

A. Chemistry

![Chem scene](../assets/lessons/14-change-sensitivity/scene_A_chem.png)

*A tiny change in bond length changes energy; the slope is 'force'.*

B. Math

![Math scene](../assets/lessons/14-change-sensitivity/scene_B_math.png)

*Tangent line: local slope at a point.*

C. World

![World scene](../assets/lessons/14-change-sensitivity/scene_C_world.png)

*Small steering input changes car path; sensitivity is local.*

## Diagnosis

Recognition sentence:
- **If you care about how output responds to an infinitesimal input change → therefore CHANGE.**

Fast checks:

- [ ] I can distinguish average change (Δy/Δx) from instantaneous change.
- [ ] I know what variable is changing and what is held fixed.
- [ ] I can interpret sign and units of the derivative.

## The object

Object: derivative as local sensitivity. In chemistry: gradients (forces), response coefficients.

## The tool

Operations you can do:

- Compute slope from a limiting process.
- Interpret derivative units (output units / input units).
- Use derivative sign to predict direction of change.

## Chemistry anchors

- Force is minus gradient of potential energy: F = −dU/dx.
- Rate laws: instantaneous rate v = d[Product]/dt.
- Thermo response: (∂G/∂T)_P = −S (preview of partial derivatives).

## Verification habit

Before you accept a result, run one of these:
- Change the description (units/coordinates/basis) and confirm the *invariant* claim.
- Push a parameter toward a boundary (very small / very large) and see if your rule still makes sense.

## Exercises (with solutions)

**1.** For y=x^3, compute dy/dx.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**3x^2**.

</details>

**2.** At x=2 for y=x^3, what is slope?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**12**.

</details>

**3.** If U(x)=x^2, what is force F(x) = −dU/dx?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**−2x**.

</details>

**4.** What does a negative derivative mean?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Increasing x decreases y locally.

</details>

**5.** Units: if [A] in M and t in s, units of d[A]/dt?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**M/s**.

</details>

**6.** Compute derivative of y=sin x.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**cos x**.

</details>

**7.** Average slope of y=x^2 from x=1 to 2?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

(4−1)/(2−1)=**3**.

</details>

**8.** Why is 'instantaneous' not the same as 'small finite'?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Because it is a limit; finite steps can hide curvature.

</details>

**9.** If y decreases with x but curvature positive, what does that mean?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Slope negative; slope becoming less negative (increasing).

</details>

**10.** Compute d/dx (1/x).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**−1/x^2**.

</details>

**11.** At x=1, compare average slope from 1 to 1.1 vs derivative.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Average ≈ (1.21−1)/0.1=2.1; derivative =2.

</details>

**12.** In chemistry, what is the derivative that gives force?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Negative spatial derivative of potential energy.

</details>

**13.** Define sensitivity in one line.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Output change per input change (local).

</details>

**14.** If a rate doubles when concentration doubles, what does that hint?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

First-order dependence (linear sensitivity).

</details>
