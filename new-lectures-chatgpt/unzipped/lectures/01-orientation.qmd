Primary PRIMITIVE: SEEING (setup; map of all primitives)
Neighbors to contrast: (none — this is the map)
One-line thesis:
- After this lesson, students can name the *kind* of constraint they are facing (primitive) and run a quick verification gate before doing algebra.

## 0) Scenes (no explanation)

A. Chemistry: **Diffusion + reaction in a beaker** (a gradient becomes a flow; totals are conserved; randomness matters).  
B. Math: **The primitive map** (the order we will follow).  
C. World: **Packing + routing** (counting objects, arranging them, moving them with direction, and dealing with uncertainty).

## 1) The nine primitives (one-line definitions)

The course is not “topics.” It is **nine repeatable patterns**.

- **COLLECTION:** only amount/membership matter; rearrangements don’t change meaning.
- **ARRANGEMENT:** positions/adjacency matter; rearrangements change meaning.
- **DIRECTION:** sign and orientation matter; arrows add, not just numbers.
- **PROXIMITY:** closeness to a target/threshold; “approach” and “limit.”
- **SAMENESS:** what counts as unchanged under allowed redescriptions/operations.
- **CHANGE:** how a state responds when you turn a knob.
- **RATE:** how fast change happens; sensitivity per unit time (or per unit input).
- **ACCUMULATION:** totals built from tiny contributions; bookkeeping across steps.
- **SPREAD:** variability + many-particle thinking; distributions replace single numbers.

## 2) Recognition gates (the non-negotiables)

Before you compute, run a gate. If a gate fails, stop.

### Gate 1 — Units
If units don’t match, the step is wrong.

### Gate 2 — Sign / direction
If you change the reference direction, the sign should flip *systematically*.

### Gate 3 — Rearrangement test
If you reorder labels and the “amount” changes, you were not in **COLLECTION**.

### Gate 4 — Limiting case
Push a knob to 0, large, or symmetric. If the expression behaves absurdly, it’s wrong.

## 3) The course workflow (what you do every lesson)

1. **Name the primitive** (choose one; don’t mix unless you say why).
2. **Write the object + allowed moves** (specification).
3. **Declare “same” vs “different.”**
4. **Only then** compute with the tool.

## 4) Mini-map: one phenomenon, multiple primitives

A single chemical setup often contains multiple primitives. You must separate them.

Example: gas in a box
- **COLLECTION:** how many molecules (moles).
- **SPREAD:** velocity distribution; where molecules are at a given time.
- **DIRECTION:** net flux (arrows).
- **PROXIMITY:** approach to equilibrium.

The skill is: **know which question you are answering.**

## 5) The tool you take away today: the primitive checklist

When stuck, ask:

- What is being **counted**? (COLLECTION)
- What **pattern** matters? (ARRANGEMENT)
- Where do arrows/signs matter? (DIRECTION)
- Is this about “near” or “approach”? (PROXIMITY)
- What must remain unchanged? (SAMENESS)
- What knob is being turned? (CHANGE)
- Is speed/sensitivity central? (RATE)
- Are we adding tiny pieces? (ACCUMULATION)
- Is variability unavoidable? (SPREAD)

## 6) Exercises (15) + solutions

### 1. Primitive identification (chem)
You mix 2.0 g H₂ with 16.0 g O₂ and ask “how many moles of water can form?”
- **Answer:** COLLECTION (amount bookkeeping).

### 2. Primitive identification (chem)
You ask why water’s dipole is not zero even though it has two O–H bonds.
- **Answer:** DIRECTION (vector addition).

### 3. Primitive identification (chem)
You compare two resonance forms and ask whether they represent different molecules.
- **Answer:** SAMENESS-A (same state, different description).

### 4. Primitive identification (chem)
You ask what happens to concentration as time increases in a first-order decay.
- **Answer:** CHANGE (with time as knob) and RATE (speed is central).

### 5. Primitive identification (math)
You reorder the rows of a data table and the meaning changes.
- **Answer:** ARRANGEMENT (order mattered).

### 6. Primitive identification (world)
You estimate “minutes to arrive” from remaining distance and current speed.
- **Answer:** PROXIMITY (to destination) and RATE.

### 7. Gate check (units)
You compute energy and get units of kg·m/s.
- **Answer:** Fail Gate 1. That’s momentum units, not energy.

### 8. Gate check (limit)
Your formula for probability becomes > 1 when T → ∞.
- **Answer:** Fail Gate 4. A probability must stay in [0,1].

### 9. “Same vs different”
Two vectors have the same magnitude but different directions. Same or different?
- **Answer:** Different for DIRECTION; same for a pure magnitude question.

### 10. Rearrangement test
You shuffle molecules among labeled boxes but keep the total count fixed. What must remain unchanged?
- **Answer:** The total count (COLLECTION invariant).

### 11. Numeric (sign)
You define “east” as positive. A walk of 3 m west is what number?
- **Answer:** −3 m.

### 12. Numeric (magnitude)
Vector (3,4) has magnitude?
- **Answer:** 5.

### 13. Numeric (limit intuition)
If a reaction rate constant k doubles, what happens to the half-life for first-order decay?
- **Answer:** It halves.

### 14. Primitive boundary
Explain in one line: ARRANGEMENT vs COLLECTION.
- **Answer:** ARRANGEMENT cares about where/adjacency; COLLECTION cares only about how many/what.

### 15. Primitive boundary
Explain in one line: CHANGE vs RATE.
- **Answer:** CHANGE describes variation; RATE quantifies “per unit input/time.”
