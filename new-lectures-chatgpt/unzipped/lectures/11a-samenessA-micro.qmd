Primary primitive: **SAMENESS-A**

## Scenes

A. Chemistry

![Chem scene](../assets/lessons/11a-samenessA-micro/scene_A_chem.png)

*Benzene: two drawings, one state. You are seeing re-description.*

B. Math

![Math scene](../assets/lessons/11a-samenessA-micro/scene_B_math.png)

*A shape rotated: looks different, same object.*

C. World

![World scene](../assets/lessons/11a-samenessA-micro/scene_C_world.png)

*Same melody transposed: different notes, same pattern.*

## Diagnosis

Recognition sentence:
- **Two descriptions differ, but every predicted measurement is the same → therefore SAMENESS-A.**

Fast checks:

- [ ] If I rewrite in new units (or a new coordinate frame), the physical prediction stays identical.
- [ ] If two diagrams give the same observables, the difference is representation, not reality.
- [ ] I can name the *allowed* re-descriptions (units, basis, coordinates, resonance form).

## The object

Object: an underlying state plus a set of *equivalent* descriptions (an equivalence class).

## The tool

Operations you can do:

- Convert units without changing meaning (e.g., M ↔ mM).
- Change coordinates/basis (vector components change; vector does not).
- Swap resonance drawings (electron delocalization is the state).

## Chemistry anchors

- Resonance drawings: nitrate/benzene forms are not different molecules.
- Concentration: 0.10 M = 100 mM (same state, different description).
- Dipole moment components depend on axes; dipole magnitude does not.

## Verification habit

Before you accept a result, run one of these:
- Change the description (units/coordinates/basis) and confirm the *invariant* claim.
- Push a parameter toward a boundary (very small / very large) and see if your rule still makes sense.

## Exercises (with solutions)

**1.** Convert 0.025 M to mM.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**25 mM.** Multiply by 1000.

</details>

**2.** A vector has components (3,4) in one frame. What is invariant under rotation?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Its magnitude.** Here √(3²+4²)=5.

</details>

**3.** Two resonance drawings predict identical bond lengths experimentally. What does that imply?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

They are **descriptions of the same state**, not two states.

</details>

**4.** 0.5 L = ? mL

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**500 mL.**

</details>

**5.** If you shift energy zero by +10 kJ/mol, does ΔE for a reaction change?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**No.** Differences are invariant; absolute reference can change.

</details>

**6.** Write one example of a *bad* re-description (changes reality).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Example: changing temperature is not re-description; it changes state.

</details>

**7.** Is switching from Cartesian to polar coordinates SAMENESS-A or SAMENESS-B?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**SAMENESS-A.** Same point described differently.

</details>

**8.** If you permute labels on identical atoms, do observables change?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

No; that's re-description/symmetry (representation-level).

</details>

**9.** 0.2 atm = ? kPa (use 1 atm≈101.3 kPa)

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

≈**20.3 kPa**.

</details>

**10.** Explain in one line: why 'units' matter but shouldn't change physics.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Units change numbers, not the underlying quantity.

</details>

**11.** A molecule drawn flipped left-right: same or different?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Same if the flip is an allowed symmetry operation for the question asked.

</details>

**12.** Convert 3.0×10⁻³ mol to mmol.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**3.0 mmol**.

</details>

**13.** If concentration doubles but volume halves, moles?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

moles = cV; here unchanged.

</details>

**14.** Which is SAMENESS-A: changing basis or taking a derivative?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Changing basis. Derivative changes the object (new quantity).

</details>

**15.** State the recognition sentence in your own words.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Any equivalent paraphrase that preserves: different description, same predictions.
