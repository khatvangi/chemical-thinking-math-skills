This course treats mathematics as **grammar** for chemical reality.

We will not start from definitions. We will start from **phenomena** and the **moves** they force you to make.

## The method we will use every time

**Reality → Recognition → Tool**

1. **Reality:** a situation that refuses to be described cleanly with your current “number language.”
2. **Recognition:** you learn to spot what is *actually happening* (the primitive), and you learn the quick tests that catch wrong reasoning.
3. **Tool:** we introduce the smallest mathematical object that supports the operations the phenomenon demands.

## The nine primitives (the course spine)

**COLLECTION → ARRANGEMENT → DIRECTION → PROXIMITY → SAMENESS → CHANGE → RATE → ACCUMULATION → SPREAD**

A primitive is not a topic. It is a *type of constraint*.

- **COLLECTION:** amount/membership; rearrangement does not matter.
- **ARRANGEMENT:** pattern/adjacency; rearrangement changes meaning.
- **DIRECTION:** magnitude + orientation; sign is a direction choice.
- **PROXIMITY:** “how close”; limits and thresholds.
- **SAMENESS:** what counts as unchanged under allowed redescriptions/operations.
- **CHANGE:** how a state varies with a knob you can turn.
- **RATE:** how fast change happens; sensitivity and kinetics.
- **ACCUMULATION:** totals built from small pieces; integration and bookkeeping.
- **SPREAD:** many‑particle thinking; uncertainty and distributions.

## What you will do (not what you will memorize)

You will repeatedly answer four questions:

1. **What exists here?** (objects you manipulate)
2. **What are the allowed moves?** (operations you can do)
3. **What is the invariance test?** (what must not change)
4. **What would make the answer obviously wrong?** (unit/sign/limit checks)

## How to use the materials

- **Lecture notes (.qmd):** the argument and the checks.
- **Pluto notebooks (.jl):** sliders that let you vary reality and watch invariants survive or fail.
- **Nibble cards:** short recognition drills + a few numerics to keep precision sharp between lectures.

If you do the recognition checks, the “math” stops feeling like authority and starts feeling like a dependable machine.
