# Lecture 08 — Transformations
Primary PRIMITIVE: **ARRANGEMENT**  
Neighbors to contrast: **DIRECTION**, **SAMENESS-B**

One-line thesis:
- After this, students can encode “do the same move to every vector” as a matrix.

## 0) Scenes (label only)
A. Chemistry: same molecule, rotated coordinates

B. Math: a square transformed

C. World: same shape, different scale  
![](../assets/lessons/08-transformations/scene_C_world.png)

## 1) Diagnosis
Recognition sentence:
- **“I apply the same rule to many vectors/points.”**

Fast checks:
- [ ] Input and output are both vectors (or points).
- [ ] The rule respects addition and scaling (linear).
- [ ] The rule is fully determined by what it does to basis vectors.

Boundary line:
- **DIRECTION** names the arrow.
- **ARRANGEMENT** builds a machine that transforms arrows.

## 2) What exists here (spec)
- Object: a **linear transformation** \(T:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n\).
- Allowed descriptions: a matrix \(A\) such that \(T(\vec v)=A\vec v\).
- “Same” means: two matrices represent the same \(T\) if they produce the same outputs for all inputs (in the same basis).
- “Different” means: outputs differ for at least one input.

## 3) What you compute
Primary quantity:
- Output vector \(A\vec v\).

Secondary quantities:
- Determinant (area/volume scale) — used next lecture for invariants.

## 4) Operation
Operation: **matrix–vector multiplication**.
- Input: \(A\) and \(\vec v\)
- Output: \(\vec w=A\vec v\)

## 5) Tool ladder
**L0:** push a shape through a “machine.”  
**L1:** \(A\vec v\) is computed entrywise with dot-products of rows with \(\vec v\).  
**L2:** columns interpretation (from Lecture 07): \(A\vec v\) is a weighted sum of columns.  
**L3:** coordinate changes, rotations, scalings, and coupling between coordinates.

## 6) One theorem that matters
**Theorem:** A linear transformation is determined by its action on a basis.

Proof sketch:
- Any \(\vec v\) can be written as \(\vec v=\sum_i v_i \hat e_i\).
- By linearity, \(T(\vec v)=\sum_i v_i T(\hat e_i)\).
- So knowing \(T(\hat e_i)\) for each basis vector determines \(T(\vec v)\) for all \(\vec v\).

What it buys you:
- You can build \(A\) by stacking transformed basis vectors as columns.

## 7) One real computation (from shipped data)
Dataset:
- File: `assets/lessons/08-transformations/data/transforms_2d.csv`

Task:
- Pick a named transform and apply it to \((1,0)\), \((0,1)\), and \((1,1)\).
- Interpret the result as “what happened to the axes and to a diagonal.”

Sanity checks:
- For a pure rotation, lengths should be preserved (next lecture).
- For a scaling, lengths scale by the factor.

## 8) Invariance test (preview)
Change of description: rotate coordinates vs rotate object.
Claim: a *coordinate change* should not change physical distances; a *physical transform* can.

## 9) Chemistry anchors
### Anchor A — Rotating molecular coordinates
- You see: the same geometry written in different frames.
- You compute: apply a rotation matrix to every atom coordinate.
- You conclude: the molecule is the same; only the description changed.

### Anchor B — Coupled coordinates (normal modes preview)
- You see: one coordinate “mixes into” another.
- You compute: a matrix with off-diagonal terms.
- You conclude: transformations can create coupled motion.

### Anchor C — Imaging and instrumentation
- You see: a detector grid.
- You compute: linear transforms (gain, mixing) applied to measurement vectors.
- You conclude: calibration is a matrix.

## 10) Notebook spec (Pluto)
Notebook: `notebooks/Lecture_08_Transformations.jl`
- Sliders: rotation angle \(\theta\), scale \(s_x, s_y\), and shear \(k\).
- Visual: transform a set of points + show the matrix.
- Structure check: verify “basis determines transform.”

## 11) Misconceptions (tests)
- If you think “a matrix is just a table,” apply it to \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\) and interpret columns.
- If you think “rotation = just changing coordinates,” compare transforming the object vs transforming the axes.

## 12) Code interpretation
- Code implements \(A\vec v\) and draws the transformed shape so you can see the rule.
