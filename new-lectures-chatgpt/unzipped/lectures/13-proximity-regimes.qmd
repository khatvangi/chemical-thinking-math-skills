Primary primitive: **PROXIMITY**

## Scenes

A. Chemistry

![Chem scene](../assets/lessons/13-proximity-regimes/scene_A_chem.png)

*One chemical law splits into different approximations depending on regime (dilute vs concentrated).*

B. Math

![Math scene](../assets/lessons/13-proximity-regimes/scene_B_math.png)

*Same expression behaves differently for small vs large inputs.*

C. World

![World scene](../assets/lessons/13-proximity-regimes/scene_C_world.png)

*Driving in city vs highway: same car, different dominant terms.*

## Diagnosis

Recognition sentence:
- **If different scales make different terms dominate → therefore PROXIMITY (regimes).**

Fast checks:

- [ ] I can name the small/large parameter that defines the regime.
- [ ] I can justify dropping/keeping terms by comparing magnitudes.
- [ ] I can state where the approximation fails.

## The object

Object: asymptotic / regime-based approximations (Taylor, dominant balance).

## The tool

Operations you can do:

- Use series expansions for small parameters.
- Use leading-order scaling for large parameters.
- State validity window (inequalities).

## Chemistry anchors

- Ideal gas: good at low density; real-gas terms matter at higher density.
- Arrhenius: ln k vs 1/T becomes linear in an appropriate regime.
- Debye–Hückel: works at low ionic strength; breaks at higher I.

## Verification habit

Before you accept a result, run one of these:
- Change the description (units/coordinates/basis) and confirm the *invariant* claim.
- Push a parameter toward a boundary (very small / very large) and see if your rule still makes sense.

## Exercises (with solutions)

**6.** As x→0, compare x and x^2. Which dominates?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**x** dominates.

</details>

**7.** If y=1/(1+x), give small-x approximation.
