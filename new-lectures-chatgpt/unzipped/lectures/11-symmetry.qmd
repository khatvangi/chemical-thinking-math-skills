Primary primitive: **SAMENESS-B**

## Scenes

A. Chemistry

![Chem scene](../assets/lessons/11-symmetry/scene_A_chem.png)

*Symmetric molecule as 'same after rotation' (preview, not group theory).*

B. Math

![Math scene](../assets/lessons/11-symmetry/scene_B_math.png)

*Rotate a square: after 90° it matches itself.*

C. World

![World scene](../assets/lessons/11-symmetry/scene_C_world.png)

*Key idea: some moves change appearance but not identity.*

## Diagnosis

Recognition sentence:
- **If a move changes the picture but leaves the object unchanged → symmetry is the invariant move-set → therefore SAMENESS-B.**

Fast checks:

- [ ] After a rotation/reflection, I can superimpose the object exactly.
- [ ] The quantity I care about is unchanged under that move.
- [ ] I can list the moves that preserve the object (even informally).

## The object

Object: a transformation that maps the object onto itself (symmetry). Invariants: quantities unchanged under those transformations.

## The tool

Operations you can do:

- Test invariance by applying a move (rotate/reflect) and comparing.
- Use symmetry to reduce work (compute once, copy by symmetry).
- Predict zero-components: symmetry can force cancellations.

## Chemistry anchors

- Molecular symmetry and dipole: some symmetries force net dipole to 0.
- Spectra selection rules (preview): symmetry controls what can couple.
- Crystal symmetry: repeating unit + invariance under translation.

## Verification habit

Before you accept a result, run one of these:
- Change the description (units/coordinates/basis) and confirm the *invariant* claim.
- Push a parameter toward a boundary (very small / very large) and see if your rule still makes sense.

## Exercises (with solutions)

**1.** A perfect square: how many 90° rotations return it to itself?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**4** (0°,90°,180°,270°).

</details>

**2.** A molecule has an inversion center. What often happens to its dipole?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Dipole is often **0** because vectors cancel under inversion symmetry.

</details>

**3.** If a quantity changes sign under reflection, what can symmetry force its average to be?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**0** (cancellation).

</details>

**4.** Is symmetry a re-description (A) or a real invariance under transformation (B)?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**B**.

</details>

**5.** Name one symmetry operation common in chemistry.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Rotation, reflection, inversion, improper rotation, translation.

</details>

**6.** A linear molecule CO2: why is dipole 0 but bonds are polar?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Bond dipoles cancel due to symmetry (opposite directions).

</details>

**7.** If you rotate axes, is that symmetry or re-description?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

As physics: re-description (A). As object-level: if molecule maps to itself, symmetry (B).

</details>

**8.** Water: why does it have a dipole but CO2 does not?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Bent geometry breaks cancellation; CO2 is linear and cancels.

</details>

**9.** A regular hexagon: smallest rotation that maps to itself?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**60°**.

</details>

**10.** What is the 'verification habit' for symmetry claims?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Apply the transformation; check invariants.

</details>

**11.** Does chirality matter for mirror symmetry?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Yes; chiral objects are not superimposable on mirrors.

</details>

**12.** If an operation changes the object, is it in the symmetry set?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

No.

</details>

**13.** Give one example where symmetry reduces computation.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Compute field in one quadrant; replicate by symmetry.

</details>

**14.** How can symmetry predict 'forbidden' transitions (preview)?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

If initial×operator×final doesn't contain totally symmetric representation, coupling vanishes.

</details>

**15.** State the recognition sentence in 1 line.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Any equivalent statement about moves that change appearance but not identity.
