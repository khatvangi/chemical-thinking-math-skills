# Lecture 06 — Coordinates
Primary PRIMITIVE: **DIRECTION**  
Neighbors to contrast: **COLLECTION**, **ARRANGEMENT**

One-line thesis:
- After this, students can move between **geometry** and **numbers** without changing the object.

## 0) Scenes (label only)
A. Chemistry: water as coordinates  
![](../assets/lessons/06-coordinates/scene_A_chem.png)

B. Math: a vector and its coordinates  
![](../assets/lessons/06-coordinates/scene_B_math.png)

C. World: a location as coordinates  
![](../assets/lessons/06-coordinates/scene_C_world.png)

## 1) Diagnosis
Recognition sentence:
- **“The object has direction, but I can describe it with numbers once I pick axes.”**

Fast checks:
- [ ] If I rotate the axes, the coordinate numbers change but the arrow in space does not.
- [ ] A sign matters (left vs right).
- [ ] Two coordinate lists can represent the same geometric arrow (in different bases).

Boundary line:
- **ARRANGEMENT** is about grids/tables of numbers.
- **DIRECTION** is about arrows and how we describe them.

## 2) What exists here (spec)
- Object: a **vector** (displacement, bond vector, dipole direction).
- Allowed descriptions: coordinates in a chosen basis (e.g., \((x,y,z)\)).
- “Same” means: same geometric arrow in space, even if the coordinate list changes because the axes change.
- “Different” means: the arrow changes (direction and/or length), not just the description.

Sanity rule:
- If I change only the basis, all **physical predictions** must stay the same.

## 3) What you compute
Primary quantity:
- Name: **components**
- Formula: \(\vec v = v_x \hat i + v_y \hat j (+ v_z \hat k)\)
- Units: same as \(\vec v\) (meters, Å, Debye, …)
- Interpretation: “how much of \(\vec v\) points along each axis.”

Secondary quantity:
- Name: **magnitude**
- Formula: \(|\vec v|=\sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2(+v_z^2)}\)
- Meaning: length of the arrow.

## 4) Operation
Operation: **coordinate extraction** = “project onto basis directions.”
- Input: \(\vec v\)
- Output: numbers \((v_x, v_y, v_z)\)

## 5) Tool ladder
**L0:** draw the arrow; drop perpendiculars to axes.  
**L1:** \(\vec v=(v_x,v_y,v_z)\) depends on chosen axes.  
**L2:** changing axes is a **transformation** of coordinates (next lessons).  
**L3:** chemistry stores geometry as coordinate tables (XYZ files, PDB, quantum outputs).

## 6) One theorem that matters
**Theorem:** In an orthonormal basis, \(|\vec v|^2 = v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2\).

Proof sketch:
- Write \(\vec v = v_x\hat i + v_y\hat j + v_z\hat k\).
- Compute \(\vec v\cdot\vec v\).
- Cross-terms vanish because \(\hat i\cdot\hat j=0\), etc.
- \(\hat i\cdot\hat i=1\), etc.
- So \(\vec v\cdot\vec v=v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2\).
- Take square root.

What it buys you:
- You can compute geometric length from coordinates and **check invariance** later.

## 7) One real computation (from shipped data)
Dataset:
- File: `assets/lessons/06-coordinates/data/water_coords.csv`

Task: compute the two O–H bond vectors and their lengths.

Sanity checks:
- Order of magnitude: O–H should be ~1 Å.
- Extreme case: if H = O, length = 0.

## 8) Invariance test (anti-float)
Change of description: rotate the coordinate axes.
Quantity claimed invariant: bond length \(|\vec r_{OH}|\).
Demonstration idea: compute length before/after rotation; it must match.

## 9) Chemistry anchors
### Anchor A — Bond vectors from coordinates
- You see: XYZ/PDB coordinates.
- You compute: \(\vec r_{AB}\) and \(|\vec r_{AB}|\).
- You conclude: bond lengths/angles are geometric invariants.

### Anchor B — Dipole direction
- You see: partial charges separated in space.
- You compute: direction of \(\sum_i q_i \vec r_i\) (up to conventions).
- You conclude: polarity depends on vector addition, not scalar counts.

### Anchor C — Gradients point “uphill”
- You see: potential energy as a surface.
- You compute: gradient direction (conceptual).
- You conclude: “steepest increase” is a direction object.

## 10) Notebook spec (Pluto)
Notebook: `notebooks/Lecture_06_Coordinates.jl`
- Sliders: angle \(\theta\) for rotating axes; a point’s coordinates; length display.
- Visual 1: rotate basis vs rotate object (contrast).
- Visual 2: compute bond vectors from `water_coords.csv`.

## 11) Misconceptions (tests)
- If you think “coordinates are the object,” rotate axes and watch the coordinates change while the arrow stays.
- If you think “signs don’t matter,” flip an axis; watch a component change sign.

## 12) Code interpretation
- Code blocks exist only to **verify arithmetic** and **load the shipped CSV**.
- Nothing depends on software. The math is the source of truth.

## Exercises (15)

### 1) Diagnosis: object vs description
You are given \((3,2)\) in some coordinate system. Is this a *vector* or a *point description*? Write one sentence that disambiguates.

### 2) Diagnosis: changing axes
If you rotate the axes by 90°, do the coordinates of the same arrow change? Yes/no + one sentence why.

### 3) Compute: magnitude
Compute \(|(3,4)|\).

### 4) Compute: bond vector
O at (0,0), H at (0.9584,0). Compute \(ec r_{OH}\) and its length (Å).

### 5) Compute: difference of coordinates
A at (1,2,0), B at (4,0,0). Compute \(ec r_{AB}\).

### 6) Compute: unit vector
Find the unit vector in the direction of \((6,8)\).

### 7) Compute: component sign
A displacement is \((-2,5)\). Which component is negative? What does that mean geometrically?

### 8) Model: pick axes
You measure a molecule in a tilted coordinate frame. What operation converts to your lab frame? Name it.

### 9) Explain: invariance
Why must bond length be invariant under a coordinate change? One sentence.

### 10) Quick magnitude 1
Compute \(|(1,1,1)|\).

### 11) Quick magnitude 2

### 12) Quick magnitude 3

### 14) Quick magnitude 5
Compute \(|(0,0,0)|\).

### 15) Quick magnitude 6
Compute \(|(-1,-1)|\).

## Solutions (key)

### 1)
It is a coordinate description; it becomes a vector only after you specify the basis/origin (what the axes mean).

### 2)
Yes. Coordinates depend on the chosen basis; the geometric arrow does not.

### 3)
\(|(3,4)|=\sqrt{3^2+4^2}=5\).

### 4)

### 5)
\(ec r_{AB}=(3,-2,0)\).

### 6)
Magnitude = 10, unit = (0.6,0.8).

### 7)

### 8)
A change of basis (rotation) represented by a transformation matrix.

### 9)
Bond length is a physical distance; coordinate changes only re-label the same geometry.
