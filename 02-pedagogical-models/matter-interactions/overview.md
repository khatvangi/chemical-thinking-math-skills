# Matter & Interactions (Chabay & Sherwood)

## Book Information
- **Title:** Matter & Interactions, 4th Edition
- **Authors:** Ruth Chabay & Bruce Sherwood
- **Publisher:** Wiley
- **ISBN:** 978-1118875865

## Core Philosophy

### Fundamental Principles First
- Start with fundamental principles (momentum, energy)
- Derive results rather than memorize formulas
- Atomic-level models of matter

### Computational Integration
- VPython/GlowScript for visualization
- Computational modeling as core skill
- Iterative numerical methods

### Modern Physics Early
- Special relativity in first semester
- Quantum concepts introduced naturally
- 20th century physics not relegated to end

## Key Innovations

### Three Fundamental Principles
1. The Momentum Principle (Newton's 2nd law)
2. The Energy Principle (conservation of energy)
3. The Angular Momentum Principle

### Unified Approach
- Same principles apply to all scales
- Atoms to galaxies
- Classical to quantum

## Relevance to Chem-Math Course

### What to Adopt
- Fundamental principles approach
- Computational modeling
- Atomic-level thinking
- Derivation over memorization

### Chemistry Connections
- Atomic models of matter
- Energy in chemical systems
- Electromagnetic interactions
