### Pedagogical Philosophy
**Feynman's Preface:** https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_91.html

## Why This is a Model

### Phenomenon-First Approach
- Starts with real physical situations
- Mathematics emerges from need to describe
- Enthusiasm and wonder maintained throughout

### Key Pedagogical Features
1. Deep conceptual explanations
2. Multiple representations of same idea
3. Historical and philosophical context
4. "Maintain interest of enthusiastic students"

## Chapters Most Relevant to Chem-Math Course
