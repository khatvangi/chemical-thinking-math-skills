## Reality → Recognition → Tool

Traditional math courses say: *"Here's a tool. Find applications."*

We invert this: *"See reality. Recognize the pattern. Summon the tool."*

## The 9 Primitives

Before "math" or "chemistry," there is human cognition parsing reality.

| Primitive | You Notice... | Math Emerges | Chemistry Example |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **COLLECTION** | "There are many" | Sets, counting | Moles, electrons |
| **ARRANGEMENT** | "Order matters" | Permutations, matrices | Stereoisomers |
| **DIRECTION** | "It points" | Vectors | Bond angles, dipoles |
| **PROXIMITY** | "Near vs far" | Functions, limits | Potential energy |
| **SAMENESS** | "Unchanged" | Eigenvalues, symmetry | Molecular symmetry |
| **CHANGE** | "Becoming" | Derivatives | Reactions |
| **RATE** | "How fast" | Diff equations | Kinetics |
| **ACCUMULATION** | "All together" | Integrals | Work, yield |
| **SPREAD** | "Distributed" | Probability | Boltzmann |
