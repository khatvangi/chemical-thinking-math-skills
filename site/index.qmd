## What Makes This Course Different?

Traditional math courses say: *"Here's a tool. Find applications."*

**We invert this:** *"See reality. Recognize the pattern. Summon the tool."*

| Traditional Approach | Chemical Thinking |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Learn derivatives → Apply to kinetics | See reaction rates → Recognize CHANGE → Derivatives emerge |
| Memorize matrix operations | See molecular symmetry → Recognize ARRANGEMENT → Matrices emerge |
| Abstract vector algebra | See bond angles → Recognize DIRECTION → Vectors emerge |

## The 9 Primitives

Before "math" or "chemistry," there is human cognition parsing reality. We perceive through fundamental patterns:

::: {.g-col-4}
### Structure
- **COLLECTION** — "There are many"
- **ARRANGEMENT** — "Order matters"
- **DIRECTION** — "It points"
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
### Change
- **PROXIMITY** — "Near vs far"
- **SAMENESS** — "Unchanged"
- **CHANGE** — "Becoming"
:::

::: {.g-col-4}
### Probability
- **RATE** — "How fast"
- **ACCUMULATION** — "All together"
- **SPREAD** — "Distributed"

    A[📖 Read Lecture] --> B[🔬 See Phenomenon]
    B --> C[🧠 Recognize Primitive]
    C --> D[🔧 Learn Tool]
    D --> E[💪 Practice]

```

### Adaptive Practice System

Our IXL-style practice system:

1. **Attempt a problem** based on real chemistry
2. **Get instant feedback** from AI tutor
3. **If wrong** → Worked example + similar problem
4. **Repeat until mastery** (3 correct in a row)
5. **Progress tracked** automatically
