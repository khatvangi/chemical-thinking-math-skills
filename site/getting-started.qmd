## Welcome, Student!

This guide will help you get set up and understand how to use all features of the Chemical Thinking course.

## Step 2: Understand the Course Structure

### The Learning Flow

```
📖 Lecture → 🧪 Interactive Demo → 💪 Practice → ✅ Mastery → 📝 Homework
```

### Navigation Map

| Section | What You'll Find | When to Use |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| **Home** | Course overview, quick links | Starting point |
| **Lectures** | Content organized by module | Learning new material |
| **Practice** | Interactive problems with AI feedback | Building mastery |
| **Homework** | Assigned problems to submit | Weekly assignments |
| **Progress** | Your mastery dashboard | Tracking advancement |

---

## Step 3: How to Study Each Lecture

Each lecture follows the **Reality → Recognition → Tool** pattern:

### 1. The Hook (2 min)
Start with a real chemical phenomenon. Look at it. What do you notice?

### 2. Recognition (5 min)
Which primitive are you seeing? Is something pointing (DIRECTION)? Changing (CHANGE)? Spreading out (SPREAD)?

### 3. The Tool (15 min)
Now learn the mathematical machinery that captures this pattern. We don't memorize formulas—we understand why they work.

### 4. Interactive (10 min)
Play with sliders. Change parameters. See how the math responds to the chemistry.

### 5. Practice (20 min)
Attempt problems until you achieve mastery (3 correct in a row).

## Step 4: Using the Practice System

Our adaptive practice system works like IXL:

::: {.panel-tabset}

### How It Works

1. **Go to [Practice Hub](practice/index.qmd)**
2. **Select a primitive** (e.g., DIRECTION)
3. **Read the problem** — it's always based on real chemistry
4. **Submit your answer**
5. **Get instant feedback:**
   - ✅ Correct → Progress toward mastery
   - ❌ Wrong → Explanation + worked example + similar problem
6. **Achieve mastery:** 3 correct answers in a row

### Mastery Levels

| Level | Meaning | Visual |
|-------|---------|--------|
| No attempts | Haven't started | ⬜⬜⬜ |
| In progress | Working on it | 🟨⬜⬜ |
| Almost there | 2/3 correct | 🟨🟨⬜ |
| Mastered | 3/3 correct | 🟩🟩🟩 |

### Tips for Success

- **Don't guess** — Read carefully, think about the primitive
- **Use hints** — They're there to help, not penalize
- **Learn from mistakes** — Read the worked examples
- **Take breaks** — Mastery comes with rest

## Step 5: Submitting Homework

Homework is assigned weekly and covers material from lectures.

### How to Submit

1. **Go to [Homework](homework/index.qmd)**
2. **Select the current assignment**
3. **Complete all problems** — Similar to practice, but graded
4. **Submit before deadline**
5. **View feedback** after grading

### Homework vs Practice

| Feature | Practice | Homework |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Deadline | None | Weekly |
| Attempts | Unlimited | One submission |
| Grading | Mastery-based | Points-based |
| Feedback | Instant | After deadline |
| Purpose | Learning | Assessment |
