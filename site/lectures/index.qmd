## How to Use Lectures

Each lecture follows the **Reality → Recognition → Tool** pattern:

1. **Start with the Hook** — A real chemical phenomenon
2. **Recognize the Primitive** — What pattern are you seeing?
3. **Learn the Tool** — The math that captures this pattern
4. **Play with Interactives** — Change parameters, see relationships
5. **Practice until Mastery** — 3 correct in a row
