<span class="primitive-badge primitive-DIRECTION">DIRECTION</span>

## Before Any Formalism

Close your eyes. Point at something.

You just did DIRECTION. No math required. No coordinates. No vectors. Your arm extended *toward*.

This is the primitive. Everything else is elaboration.

---

## The First Direction

Before you had words, you had direction.

An infant reaches. Not randomly — *toward* the face, *toward* the breast, *toward* the light. Reaching is the first intentional act. It has a *from* (the body) and a *to* (the object). The infant doesn't know "direction" but the infant *does* direction.

Developmental psychologists call this **goal-directed behavior**. But that's just academic language for: the child points itself at the world.

---

## Direction is Binary Before It Is Continuous

The first distinction isn't "which angle?" It's simpler:

**Toward / Away**

This is the ur-direction. The amoeba moves *toward* nutrients and *away from* toxins. No angles. No degrees. Just: approach or flee.

<div id="toward-away-visual" class="interactive-container"></div>

Everything else elaborates this binary.

---

## Direction in the World

**Gravity**
Drop something. It falls *down*. Not sideways. Not up. Down. The universe has a preferred direction at every point near mass.

**Light**
The sun is *there*. Light comes *from* there *to* here. You don't see in all directions equally — you see what's in front of your eyes. Vision is directional.

**Rivers**
Water flows *from* mountains *to* sea. Not the reverse. The landscape has direction built into it.

**Wind**
Air moves. It comes *from* somewhere, goes *to* somewhere. You feel it on one side of your face, not the other.

**Growth**
Trees grow *up*. Roots grow *down*. Sunflowers turn *toward* the sun. Life knows direction.

**Time**
Yesterday is *behind*. Tomorrow is *ahead*. We speak of time spatially because DIRECTION is how we parse sequence.

---

## Direction in Animals

**Predator and prey**
The lion faces the gazelle. The gazelle faces away. Survival depends on knowing which way threats point.

**Migration**
Birds fly south. Whales swim to breeding grounds. Salmon return upstream. Animals navigate — they know *toward*.

**Attention**
Where is the cat looking? Follow its gaze. Attention *points*. We read direction in other minds.

---

## Direction in the Body

| Experience | Direction |
|------------|-----------|
| Reaching | Arm extends *toward* object |
| Walking | Body moves *forward* |
| Looking | Eyes aim *at* |
| Pointing | Finger indicates *there* |
| Turning | Body rotates to *face* |
| Breathing | Air flows *in*, then *out* |
| Listening | Head tilts *toward* sound |

We are direction-perceiving, direction-producing beings. It's not learned. It's what having a body means.

---

## The Six Directions from the Body

Once you have a body that moves, directions emerge:

**Forward / Back** — An animal that moves has a front. The front is where you're going. The back is where you've been.

**Left / Right** — Perpendicular to forward. They define your body plane.

**Up / Down** — Perpendicular to the ground plane. Against or with gravity.

| Direction | Bodily Basis |
|-----------|--------------|
| Forward | Where the face points |
| Backward | Behind the head |
| Left | Arm-side |
| Right | Arm-side |
| Up | Against gravity |
| Down | With gravity |

<div id="body-directions-visual" class="interactive-container"></div>

**This is not mathematics imposed on the body. This is the body generating mathematics.**

---

## Direction in Language

We can't speak without direction:

- "Go **to** the store"
- "Come **from** work"
- "Look **at** this"
- "Turn **toward** me"
- "Move **away** from the edge"
- "The road leads **into** the mountains"

Prepositions are direction words. Grammar encodes DIRECTION.

---

## Direction in Mind

| Mental State | Direction |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Attention** | Points *at* object of focus |
| **Intention** | Points *toward* goal |
| **Desire** | Points *toward* wanted |
| **Fear** | Points *away from* threat |
| **Memory** | Points *backward* in time |
| **Hope** | Points *forward* in time |
| **Reasoning** | Points *from* premise *to* conclusion |

Thought itself is directional. "Where is this argument going?" "What follows from this?"

---

## Direction as Relation

A direction is not a thing. It's a *relation between things*.

"The library is north" — north of what? Of here. Of me.

"The bond points toward oxygen" — from where? From carbon.

Every direction has an **origin** (the "from") and an **orientation** (the "toward").

This is why vectors have a tail and a head. Not because mathematicians decided it. Because direction has a source and an aim.

---

## Direction Without Movement

Critical insight: **direction does not require motion**.

A compass needle points north even when nothing moves.
A signpost points to the city even standing still.
A bond points from atom to atom in a frozen crystal.

Direction is about **orientation**, not **motion**.

---

## Continuous Direction: The Circle

Toward/away gave us two directions.
Forward/back/left/right gave us four.
Add up/down, we have six.

But direction is not discrete. Between north and east lies northeast. Between northeast and north lies north-northeast. And so on.

Direction, in a plane, is a **circle**.

Every point on the circle is a direction. Infinite directions. The angle θ parameterizes them.

<div id="circle-directions-visual" class="interactive-container"></div>

**The circle is the space of all directions in 2D.**

---

## The Sphere of Directions (3D)

In three dimensions, direction is a **sphere**.

Every point on the sphere's surface is a direction you could point.

- North pole: straight up
- South pole: straight down
- Equator: all horizontal directions

Two angles parameterize it: θ (azimuth) and φ (elevation).

<div id="sphere-directions-visual" class="interactive-container"></div>

**The sphere is the space of all directions in 3D.**

This is what the owl's head does when it swivels — it samples the sphere of directions.

---

## Combining Directions

What happens when two directions meet?

<div id="combining-directions-visual" class="interactive-container"></div>

**Case 1: Same direction**
They reinforce. Two arrows pointing the same way make a stronger "point."

**Case 2: Opposite directions**
They oppose. Two arrows pointing opposite ways cancel.

**Case 3: Perpendicular directions**
They're independent. Neither reinforces nor opposes.

**Case 4: Oblique directions**
Partial reinforcement, partial independence.

*How do we measure "how much of direction A is in direction B"?*

This question **demands** the dot product. But we're not there yet. We're just noticing that directions can be compared.

---

## Direction and Magnitude

Some directions come with "how much":

- The wind blows east — but how strongly?
- The hill slopes down — but how steeply?
- The pull is toward Earth — but how hard?

**Magnitude** is the "how much" attached to direction.

Together, direction + magnitude = **vector**.

But notice: you can have direction without magnitude (a compass heading), and you can have magnitude without direction (temperature). The vector is the *combination*.

---

## Direction in Gradients

A landscape has high points and low points.

At any location, there is a direction called "steepest uphill." This is the **gradient**.

<div id="gradient-visual" class="interactive-container"></div>

The gradient is not just "uphill" — it's the *direction of greatest increase*.

In chemistry:

- **Concentration gradient**: molecules diffuse *down* the gradient (high → low)
- **Potential energy gradient**: systems move *down* the gradient (toward lower energy)
- **Electric potential gradient**: charges move *down* the gradient

Gradient = "which way is uphill?"

---

## Direction in Causation

"A causes B"

This is a direction. From A to B. Not from B to A.

Causation has an arrow. The arrow points from cause to effect.

<div id="causation-visual" class="interactive-container"></div>

This is not metaphor. Causation *is* directional. The asymmetry of time makes it so. Effects don't precede causes.

Every mechanism in chemistry is a sequence of causal arrows:

```
Nucleophile → Electrophile → Transition state → Product
```

DIRECTION again.

---

## What DIRECTION Is NOT

**DIRECTION ≠ Location**
"Where is it?" is different from "Which way does it point?"
A thing can be *at* a location without pointing anywhere.

**DIRECTION ≠ Distance**
"How far?" is different from "Which way?"
You can know direction without knowing distance, and vice versa.

**DIRECTION ≠ Motion**
A stationary arrow still points.
Direction exists without movement.

---

## The Components of DIRECTION

When we perceive direction, what exactly do we perceive?

1. **Orientation** — the line along which it points
2. **Sense** — which way along that line (forward vs backward)
3. **Magnitude** (sometimes) — how strongly it points, how far it extends

A weathervane has orientation and sense.
A gust of wind has orientation, sense, and magnitude.

---

## Kinds of DIRECTION

| Kind | What Varies | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Spatial** | Position in space | Up, north, toward the door |
| **Temporal** | Position in time | Before, after, toward the future |
| **Causal** | Source and result | From cause to effect |
| **Intentional** | Agent and goal | Toward what is wanted |
| **Gradient** | High to low | Downhill, toward lower pressure |
| **Relational** | Between entities | From giver to receiver |

These feel different. But the cognitive act is the same: **something points**.

---

## Why DIRECTION Needs Formalization

Pointing works for simple situations. But:

- How do you describe the direction precisely enough for someone else to replicate?
- How do you combine two directions?
- How do you ask "how much of this direction is in that direction?"
- How do you compute with directions?

These questions demand a tool.

The tool is the **vector**.

But the vector is not the primitive. DIRECTION is the primitive. The vector is notation for what we already perceive.

---

## The Bridge to Formalism

| Perception | Formal Tool |
|------------|-------------|
| "It points somewhere" | Vector |
| "How aligned are these two directions?" | Dot product |
| "What's perpendicular to both?" | Cross product |
| "Which way is uphill?" | Gradient |
| "Describe this direction precisely" | Components, coordinates |

We will learn all of these. But always remember: **the perception came first**.

---

## Summary: What DIRECTION Is

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Bodily** | Reaching, facing, orienting |
| **Perceptual** | Seeing "toward" and "away from" |
| **Spatial** | The six directions, the circle, the sphere |
| **Relational** | From-to, source-target, origin-aim |
| **Causal** | Cause → effect |
| **Gradient** | Uphill direction in a field |

All of these are **the same cognitive primitive** applied in different contexts.

---

::: {.recognition-callout}
**When you see something that POINTS...**

**When ANGLES matter...**

**When ORIENTATION determines behavior...**

**When the same magnitude in a different direction gives a different result...**

You're seeing **DIRECTION**.

## Next

Now we take DIRECTION and apply it.

**First application:** [Chemistry — Bonds Point →](04-direction.qmd)

Bonds have direction. Dipoles have direction. Orbitals have direction. The vector becomes the tool for computing with what we now see.

---

**The vector is secondary. The perception came first.**
