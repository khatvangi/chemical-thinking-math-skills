## Central Thesis
Mathematical concepts are grounded in:
1. **Bodily experience** (spatial relations, motion, containment)
2. **Conceptual metaphors** (mapping from concrete to abstract)
3. **Image schemas** (recurring patterns from perception/action)

## Key Concepts

### Conceptual Metaphors in Math
- NUMBERS ARE POINTS ON A LINE
- ARITHMETIC IS OBJECT COLLECTION
- FUNCTIONS ARE MACHINES
- EQUATIONS ARE BALANCES

### Image Schemas
- CONTAINER (in/out, inside/outside)
- PATH (source-path-goal)
- LINK (connection between entities)
- PART-WHOLE
- CENTER-PERIPHERY
- BALANCE

### Basic Metaphor of Infinity (BMI)
How finite processes become conceptualized as infinite:
- Completed iterative processes
- The limit concept
- Infinite sets

## Application to Chemistry-Math Course

### Chemistry Metaphors to Leverage
- Electrons "fill" orbitals (CONTAINER)
- Reactions "go" forward/backward (PATH)
- Bonds "hold" atoms together (LINK)
- Energy "flows" (SUBSTANCE)

### Course Design Implications
1. Start with concrete, embodied experiences
2. Make metaphors explicit rather than hidden
3. Use multiple representations (visual, kinesthetic, symbolic)
4. Build from intuition to formalism
