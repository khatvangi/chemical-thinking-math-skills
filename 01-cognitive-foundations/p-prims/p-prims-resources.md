# P-Prims & Knowledge-in-Pieces Resources

## Core Concept
P-prims (phenomenological primitives) are small, intuitive knowledge elements that learners develop from everyday experience. They are:
- Context-dependent
- Neither "right" nor "wrong" in isolation
- Building blocks for scientific understanding

## Key P-Prims for Chemistry-Math

### Quantity/Measurement
- MORE IS MORE
- ACCUMULATION
- BALANCE

### Spatial
- PROXIMITY (closer = more effect)
- DIRECTION
- CONTAINMENT

### Change
- EQUILIBRATION
- RESISTANCE
- FORCING

## Application to Course Design
- Identify which p-prims students bring to chemistry concepts
- Build on productive intuitions rather than fighting them
- Design activities that activate relevant p-prims
